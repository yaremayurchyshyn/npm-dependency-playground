# npm-dependency-playground

this is a working example to demonstrate that npm understands nested dependencies and perfectly resolves it

if you want to try it yourself, do:
``` bash
npm i
node index.js
```

you should get this output:
```
calling our deps... 
called from depA... 
called from depB... 
called from depC...
```
